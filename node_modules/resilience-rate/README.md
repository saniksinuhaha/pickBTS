# 🌟 Resilience Rate Project 🌟

Welcome to the Resilience Rate Project! This project uses a variety of data to calculate a resilience rate. 🚀

## 📚 What is Resilience Rate? 📚

Resilience Rate is a measure of how well a person can adapt to challenges and grow stronger through them. It's categorized into four levels:

1. **Level 5 (Fragile)**: Easily overwhelmed by setbacks. 😰
2. **Level 7 (Steady)**: Recovers with effort and support. 🚶‍♂️
3. **Level 9 (Antifragile)**: Grows stronger through challenges. 💪
4. **Level 10 (Phoenix)**: Rises from ashes, unbreakable. 🦅

## 🛠️ How Does It Work? 🛠️

This project uses several npm packages to gather data, including:

- `guess-smartphone` 📱
- `guess-iq` 🧠
- `guess-ideology` 🌐
- `guess-zodiac` ♈
- `guess-pets` 🐶
- `lucky-rate` 🍀
- `health-rate` 💓
- `creativity-rate` 🎨
- `innovation-rate` 💡

These data points are then used to calculate a resilience rate.
